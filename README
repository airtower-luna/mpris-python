=== MPRIS2 client in Python ===

mpris-python is a simple command line MPRIS2 [1] client which doubles
as a rudimentary MPRIS client library. It allows you to send commands
to any MPRIS2 compatible media player from the command line. The
dbus-python library [2] is used to communicate with the media player.

=== Usage ===

usage: mpris.py [-h] [-s N] [-v] [--commands] [command] [args [args ...]]

positional arguments:
  command            player command to execute, default: "status"
  args               arguments for the command, if any

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -s N, --service N  use the Nth MPRIS2 service available (default: 0)
  -v, --verbose      enable extra output
  --commands         list supported commands, then exit

Supported commands are:
  status    show player status
  toggle    toggle play/pause state
  stop      stop playback
  play      start playback
  pause     pause playback
  open URI  open media from URI and start playback

Note that media players can restrict what commands MPRIS clients may
send them, and some MPRIS interfaces and methods are
optional. Audacious 3.5 is known not to support opening media via
MPRIS.
